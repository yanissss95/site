<h1>My Opinion</h1>

<div class="maincontent7">
    <p class="text-articleras">
        <br><strong>
            &nbsp; In my opinion, this manga is one of the most complete manga / anime I have seen.<br>
            I discovered it in the summer of 2022 because it was in the Netflix catalog.<br>
            It was the first Viking manga I saw and it intrigued me. <br>
            I started the animated adaptation and I got hooked straight away.
            <br>As for the anime adaptation, the animations are perfect and totally correspond to the manga, each sword
            stroke is felt unlike
            other anime, we totally feel the violence of these Vikings and this era. <br>At the beginning, the
            development
            is rather put aside to leave part to the fights and the action as I like it.<br> But it still highlights one
            character in particular and that is Askeladd.<br>
            Like many people, I hated this character but grew to love him as the prologue progressed. He is, in my
            opinion, the third best character in the book.
            <br>The following part sheds light on the development of the two best characters in the work. <br>
            It's Knut and Thorfinn. The two have an inverse development but quite linked in the final objective which is
            peace.<br>
            Knut wishes to achieve peace by force, while Thorfinn wishes him to achieve it peacefully.
            <br>I am rather in
            favor of the second method, however the first as Knut shows us is effective and above all much faster.<br> I
            really like the development of Thorfinn which had several phases, first the innocent phase when he was a
            child then the violent phase during his adolescence to finally move on to the phase of today which is the
            adult phase and which is much more thoughtful and therefore pleasant. <br>Knut is rather the opposite with
            his
            teenage phase where he is quite reserved and fearful and his adult phase when he becomes king and becomes
            much more dominant and unscrupulous.<br> Development is what I love about this manga.
            <br>All the characters are
            fairly well developed and have a great story for the most part (except Floki).<br>
            The rest of the developments I leave it to you and advise you all to start watching this masterpiece and
            enjoying it quietly at home. BYE.
